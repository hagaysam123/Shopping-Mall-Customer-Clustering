# Shopping-Mall-Customer-Clustering

This project analyzes customer behavior patterns at a shopping mall using unsupervised learning techniques. It leverages the K-Means, Hierarchical Clustering, and DBSCAN algorithms from Scikit-learn to group customers into distinct clusters based on their spending scores, annual income, and potentially another chosen feature.
